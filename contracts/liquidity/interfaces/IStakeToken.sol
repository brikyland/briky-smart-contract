 *  @author Briky Team
 *
 *  @notice Interface for contract `StakeToken`.
 *  @notice A `StakeToken` contract is an ERC-20 token representing a staking pool of `PrimaryToken` that accrues periodic
 *          rewards. For each staked primary token, an equivalent amount of derived stake token is minted as a placeholder
 *          balance, which increases as rewards are earned. Transferring stake tokens also transfers the underlying staked
 *          value of primary token. After culmination of the pool, unstaking allows stakers to redeem the exact amount of
 *          primary tokens.
 *  @notice There are 3 staking pools with different configurations:
 *          -   Staking pool #1: Culminates in wave  750, 2,000,000 tokens each wave.
 *          -   Staking pool #2: Culminates in wave 1500, 3,000,000 tokens each wave.
 *          -   Staking pool #3: Culminates in wave 2250, 4,000,000 tokens each wave.
 *  @notice Each rewarding wave has 1-day cooldown and the reward is distributed among stakers in proportion to their balances.
 *  @notice After all three staking pool have culminated, the staking pool #3 may still fetch new wave with the reward capped
 *          at the lesser between its standard wave reward and the remaining mintable tokens to reach the maximum supply cap.
 *  @notice Before a staking pool culminates, unstaking is prohibited, but stakers may promote their position into the
 *          successor staking pool. After culmination, unstaking is permitted while new staking incurs a fee that is
 *          contributed to the treasury liquidity.
 *  @notice Exclusive Discount: `15% + primaryDiscount * (globalStake - totalSupply) / (2 * globalStake)`.
 *          Note:   `primaryDiscount` is the exclusive discount of the primary token.
 *                  `globalStake` is the total tokens staked in 3 pools.
 *  @notice Staking fee after culmination: `value / totalSupply * treasuryLiquidity * feeRate`.
 *          Note:   `value` is the staking value that derives fee.
 *                  `treasuryLiquidity` is the liquidity reserved in the treasury.
 *                  `feeRate` is an admin-adjustable subunitary value.
