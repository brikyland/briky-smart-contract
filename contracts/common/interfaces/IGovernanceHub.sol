 *  @notice Interface for contract `GovernanceHub`.
 *  @notice The `GovernanceHub` contract facilitates voting among holders of an asset from governor contracts to decide on
 *          proposals that affects the asset.
 *
 *  @dev    With client-side support, accounts can propose by submitting a full proper context to the server-side and
 *          forwarding only its checksum to the contract as the UUID of the new proposal. Authorized executives will later
 *          verify the feasibility of the proposal within a given expiration to either admit or disqualify it accordingly.
 *          During this process, the full context is uploaded to a public database (e.g., IPFS), and the link is submitted to
 *          be the URI of proposal context. This approach protects the database from external attacks as well as ensures
 *          proposals remains validatable and user-oriented.
 *  @dev    Implementation involves server-side support.
 *  @dev    ERC-20 tokens are identified by their contract addresses.
 *          Native coin is represented by the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).
