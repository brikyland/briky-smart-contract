     *          executives will later verify the feasibility of the proposal within a given expiration to either admit or
     *          disqualify it accordingly. During this process, the full context is uploaded to a public database (e.g., IPFS),
     *          and the link is submitted to be the URI of proposal context. This approach protects the database from external
     *          attacks as well as ensures proposals remains validatable and user-oriented.
