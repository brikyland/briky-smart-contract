 *  @notice Interface for contract `EstateLiquidator`.
 * 
 *  @notice The `EstateLiquidator` contract facilitates the extraction of real estate through approved liquidations. Official
 *          disclosed accounts, who is legally qualified to own the estate, can offer to buy the entire asset with a specific
 *          value and the deal is voted to proceed. If the deal is approved, the associated custodian is grant a limited time
 *          window to complete the required administrative procedures in compliance with local regulations. Liquidation is
 *          finalized only if the custodian fulfills these obligations within the allotted timeframe. In that case, the
 *          proceeds are distributed to holders as the ultimate dividend, and then the corresponding class of estate token will
 *          be deprecated permanently.
 *
 *  @dev    Implementation involves server-side support.
 *  @dev    ERC-20 tokens are identified by their contract addresses.
 *          Native coin is represented by the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).
