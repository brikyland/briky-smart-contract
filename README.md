## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brikyland/briky-smart-contract
   cd briky-smart-contract
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Compilation

Compile all smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Local Development

### 1. Start Local Network

Launch a local Hardhat network:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This will start a local blockchain with pre-funded accounts.

### 2. Environment Configuration

1. Create an environment file from the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in the required contract and validator addresses in `.env`

3. Configure deployment constants in `scripts/deployments/<app_name>/initialization.ts`

> **Note**: Check the deployment scripts in `scripts/deployments/` to understand which addresses and constants are required.

### 3. Deploy Contracts

Deploy specific contracts using the following pattern:

```bash
npm run deploy<ContractName>:local
```

**Examples:**

- **Admin Contract**: 
  - Fill `LOCAL_ADMIN_1_ADDRESS` through `LOCAL_ADMIN_5_ADDRESS` in `.env` (use accounts from local node)
  - Run: `npm run deployAdmin:local`

- **FeeReceiver Contract**:
  - Fill `LOCAL_ADMIN_ADDRESS` in `.env`
  - Run: `npm run deployFeeReceiver:local`

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

For specific test files:

```bash
npx hardhat test test/YourTestFile.test.ts
```
